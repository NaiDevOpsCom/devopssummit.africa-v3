## About the Project

This repository contains the official website for the **Africa DevOps Summit** — a community-driven conference that brings together DevOps engineers, SREs, software developers, cloud practitioners, and tech leaders from across Africa and beyond.

The website is the event's primary digital presence, handling:

- 📣 Event marketing and promotion
- 🎤 Speaker profiles and conference schedule
- 🎟️ Ticket information and registration
- 🤝 Sponsor acquisition and engagement
- 📸 Past summit archives, photo galleries, and recaps

This is a **frontend-only** React + Vite + TypeScript application. There is no backend server. All content is either statically defined or fetched client-side from a CMS.

> **Status:** MVP complete — actively iterating. See [open issues](https://github.com/NaiDevOpsCom/devopssummit.africa-v3/issues) for what's being worked on.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding.

**Node.js** — version **18 or higher** is required.

We recommend managing Node versions with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```sh
# Install the required Node version
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Verify
node --version   # should print v18.x.x or higher
npm --version
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:NaiDevOpsCom/devopssummit.africa-v3.git
   cd devopssummit.africa-v3
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** _(see next section)_

4. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---

### Environment Variables

This project uses Vite's environment variable system. Variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser.

```sh
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Open .env.local and fill in the required values
```

Refer to `.env.example` for the full list of variables and descriptions. **Never commit `.env.local`** — it is gitignored by default.

> ⚠️ Because this is a static frontend app deployed to shared hosting, environment variables are **baked in at build time**. Do not store secrets in `VITE_` variables — they will be visible in the browser bundle.

---

### Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the local development server at `http://localhost:5173` |
| `npm run build` | Build the production-ready site into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally before deploying |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the codebase |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking without emitting files |

> 💡 Always run `npm run build` and verify it passes with no errors before opening a pull request.
