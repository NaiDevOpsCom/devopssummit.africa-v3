## 1. What This Project Is

The **Africa DevOps Summit** website (`devopssummit.africa`) is Africa's premier DevOps, Cloud & SRE conference website. It is the event's primary digital presence — handling marketing, speaker showcases, schedule, ticket information, sponsor engagement, and past summit archives.

**This is a frontend-only static SPA.** There is no backend server, no database, no server-side rendering, and no API owned by this project. Everything compiles to a flat `dist/` folder deployed to cPanel shared hosting.

**The community behind it:** The site is maintained by a mix of core organizers, volunteers, and open source contributors from the African DevOps community. Code quality, accessibility, and contributor experience matter as much as features.

## 2. Tech Stack — Exactly This, Nothing Else

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Framework | React | 18.x | Functional components + hooks only. No class components. |
| Language | TypeScript | 5.x | Strict mode. No `any`. No type assertions unless unavoidable. |
| Build Tool | Vite | 8.x | Dev server at `http://localhost:5173` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | 4.x | Utility-first. Semantic tokens only. No raw color values. |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui | Latest | Built on Radix UI. Generated into `src/components/ui/`. |
| Animations | Framer Motion | Latest | `fadeUp` variant pattern. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| Routing | React Router | v7 | Client-side SPA routing. `<Link>` and `useNavigate` only. Imports come from `react-router` not `react-router-dom`. |
| Icons | Lucide React | Latest | Import individually. Never import the entire library. |
| Fonts | Sora + Inter | — | Via Google Fonts. `font-heading` = Sora. `font-body` = Inter. |
| Sanitization | DOMPurify | Latest | Via `SafeHtml` component. Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` directly. |
| Image CDN | Cloudinary | — | `nairobidevops` account. Full URLs in data files. |
| Server state | TanStack React Query | v5 | Installed and configured. Use for all CMS/API calls. Do NOT remove. |
| Env validation | Custom | — | `src/config/validateEnv.ts`. Runs at app boot in `main.tsx`. |

### What is NOT in this project

Do not suggest, install, or reference any of the following — they are not used and should not be added without an explicit architectural decision:

- ❌ Next.js, Remix, Astro, Nuxt, SvelteKit — this is Vite + React, not a meta-framework
- ❌ Redux, Zustand, Jotai, MobX — no global state library; use React `useState`
- ❌ Axios — use native `fetch` or React Query
- ❌ Styled Components, CSS Modules, Emotion — Tailwind only
- ❌ Jest — use Vitest as the testing framework (see Section 11)
- ❌ Express, Fastify, any server framework — there is no backend
- ❌ Prisma, Mongoose, any ORM — there is no database
- ❌ `next/image`, `next/link`, `next/router` — wrong framework
- ❌ Lovable, Supabase — legacy scaffolding references, not in use

## 3. Full Project Context

This file is truncated to adhere to system limits. 

**For full project details, you are REQUIRED to read `.agents/CONTEXT.md` using your `view_file` tool.**
It includes:
1. Complete Project Structure.
2. Routing Maps.
3. Design System & CSS Variables.
4. Component Patterns (e.g., `SpeakerCard`).
5. Testing Protocols (Vitest constraints).

Do not formulate plans or write code before consulting the full `CONTEXT.md`.
